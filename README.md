# What is Composer?

[Composer][] is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to
declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install /
update) them for you.


## Installing

Pull the `composer/composer` image from the hub repository:

``` sh
docker pull composer/composer
```

Alternatively, pull a specific variant of `composer/composer`:

``` sh
docker pull composer/composer:alpine
```

## Using

Run the `composer/composer` image:

``` sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer/composer install
```

Alternatively, run a specific variant of `composer/composer`:

``` sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer/composer:alpine install
```

You can mount the Composer home directory from your host inside the Container
to share caching and configuration files:

  The contents of the file will look like this:
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
    export PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin
    echo "Current working directory: '"$(pwd)"'"
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v $HOME/.composer-docker:/composer composer/composer $@
    ```

## Suggestions

We strive to deliver an image that is as lean as possible, aimed at running
Composer only.

Sometimes dependencies or [composer scripts] require the availability of certain
PHP extensions. In this scenario, you have two options:

* create your own image (by extending from one of the variants we offer),
* pass the `--ignore-platform-reqs` and `--no-scripts` flags to `install` and
    `update`.

    ``` sh
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer/composer install --no-scripts -ignore-platform-reqs
    ```

If you want to be able to just run `composer`, you can define the following
function in your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc` or similar:

``` sh
function composer () {
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer/composer "$@"
}
```

# Image Variants

### `composer/composer:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you
probably want to use this one.

### `composer/composer:<version>-alpine`

This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project][], available in [the
`alpine` official image][]. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution
base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

### `composer/composer:<version>-php5`

This image runs the latest version of PHP 5 instead of PHP 7.

### `composer/composer:<version>-php5-alpine`

This image runs the latest version of PHP 5 instead of PHP 7.
